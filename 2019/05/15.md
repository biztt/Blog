## Install CouchDB on Ubuntu 18.04

First, enable Apache CouchDB package repository
```
sudo nano /etc/apt/sources.list
```
Add the following command to the end
```
deb https://apache.bintray.com/couchdb-deb bionic main
```
Please note the `bionic` used here is because I am using Ubuntu 18.04, this value is depends on your server version. For example, Ubuntu 16.04 is `xenial`.

Now we can install CouchDB
```
sudo apt update && sudo apt install couchdb
```
During the installation, the Graphic UI will let you do the configuration. Here we use `standalone` for the general type, then `0.0.0.0` for interface bind address which will allow all network requests. Last set the admin password twice.

Now, we can test couchDB
```
curl localhost:5984
```
It will response the version info.
```json
{
    "couchdb": "Welcome",
    "version": "2.3.1",
    "git_sha": "c298091a4",
    "uuid": "cde998b7c7988f444b26f33133f68158",
    "features": ["pluggable-storage-engines", "scheduler"],
    "vendor": {
        "name": "The Apache Software Foundation"
    }
}
```
For remote connection, we need allow `5984` port from the firewall.
```
sudo ufw allow 5984/tcp
```
Next, we add couchDB to auto start when ubuntu server start up
```
sudo systemctl start couchdb
sudo systemctl enable couchdb
```
Yeah, that's it.
