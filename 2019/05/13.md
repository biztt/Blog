## Ubuntu 18.04 setup

I am learning server side swift recently, which means I need a linux server. So, I choose ubuntu, because it is the Swift.org officially supported distribution.

When finished install ubuntu 18.04, there are several things need to be done.
- Set up ssh connection
- Disable password login
- Create a new user with sudo privileges.
- Disable root user
- Set up firewall

#### Set up ssh connection
